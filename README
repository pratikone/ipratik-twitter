Welcome to iPRATIK- my first attempt (successful, too) in making a twitter web application. It is coded entirely in php and curl rendering it suitable for any platform.
It uses Abraham Williams <abraham@abrah.am > basic OAuth library for basic OAuth functions.
***SETUP***

>>You can easily start with a AMP setup. 
>>Extract the folder "ipratik" in www folder of your AMP installation (/var/www in linux)
>>After that, you can open it up with http://127.0.0.1/ipratik/login.php
>>Click on big blue button to authenticate yourself.
>> You will be redirected to the same page with a login input at the bottom.
>>Enter credentials and click on go!
>>Voila! you are in.


The results are in unformatted text type only till now. More work is going on it.
